    /*

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

        GOOD : Completely different approach than any mentioned at leetcode site
                This is more generic (does not depend on things being integers - will work on any ordered set)
                was able to simplify the code by removing unnecessary code

        BAD : Took a while to write the code, and simplify it
             Made many mistakes
              Not fast enough according to leetcode
