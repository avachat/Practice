public class Prob0941ValidMountainArray {

    /*

Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

Recall that A is a mountain array if and only if:

A.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < A.length - 1 such that:
A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]
A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]


Example 1:

Input: [2,1]
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: [3,5,5]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: [0,3,2,1]
Output: true


Note:

0 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10000
