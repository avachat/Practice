    /*

    Given two positive integers x and y, an integer is powerful if it is equal to x^i + y^j for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0.

Return a list of all powerful integers that have value less than or equal to bound.

You may return the answer in any order.  In your answer, each value should occur at most once.



Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
Explanation:
2 = 2^0 + 3^0
3 = 2^1 + 3^0
4 = 2^0 + 3^1
5 = 2^1 + 3^1
7 = 2^2 + 3^1
9 = 2^3 + 3^0
10 = 2^0 + 3^2
Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 5, bound = 15
Output: [2,4,6,8,10,14]


Note:

1 <= x <= 100
1 <= y <= 100
0 <= bound <= 10^6

        GOOD : Better time than 100%

        BAD : Took forever to write correctly : Couldn't get two loops correct :-( :-( :-(
            Very bad on memory

            VERY complex code
            Using pow function and two loos with i, j makes the code look very simple.
            Of course by not using pow, time was really good
