public class Prob1002FindCommonChars {


    /*

    Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
Example 2:

Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]


Note:

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100
A[i][j] is a lowercase letter

        GOOD : Got quickly, almost no errors (except one silly mistake)

        BAD : Not fast enough. Why ?
            If intersection is done after every counting, it is not slower.
            Missed the big O calculation

            For example : There are 2 loops here.
            N : number of strings
            L : Length of the string
            First loop runs O(N*L) times
            Second loop runs O(26*N) times (That's also the memory needed)

            If intersection is done after every string
            Outer loop runs N times
                Inner loop to compute totals L times
                Intersection loop 26 times
            That is O(N * (L + 26)), which is same as this algo
